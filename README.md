# The prisoner riddle simulation //The Riddle That Seems Impossible Even If You Know The Answer<br>

I saw a great yt video about 'The Riddle That Seems Impossible Even If You Know The Answer' on
Veritasium chanel- and I found in quite intresting, because according to it we can improve our chances of winning in a lost position to over 30 %<br>

In few words, the conditions are:
-there is 100 prisoners<br>
-there is a room with 100 boxes.<br>
-Each box contains a card with a number between 1 and 100. <br>
-Each prisoner has to find a box with his/her number but only has 50 attempts<br>
-to win, all of 100 prisoners have to pick thier number.
<hr>
at the first glance od an eye the odds are (1/2)^100. but accorudng to the video the odds can be improved to over 30% 
Sounds impossible right? <br>


Therefore I gave it a test so you don't have to.I have coded a simulation in PHP. <br>
Before running you can set the value of describe to 1 if you want to have a detaild view of what has happened. <br>
You can also set the amount of test and modify the amount of prisones if you want to test the strategyu in diffrent scenarios.

enjoy!
